*DESCRIPTON*:

This project is a multi-page front-end layout for a simple e-learning platform. It is built using HTML for the content structure, CSS for design and styling, and JavaScript to add interactive features such as progress tracking. The platform includes three main pages: a homepage, a course listing page, and a course detail page. All pages use consistent styling and navigation to ensure a smooth user experience across the entire interface.

The homepage introduces the platform with a bold headline, short description, and a call-to-action button that links to the courses page. It uses a gradient background and centered text to create an eye-catching first impression. Navigation links at the top of the page allow users to move between the homepage and the courses section easily.

The courses page lists several example courses in a responsive grid layout. Each course is presented inside a styled card element containing a title and brief description. The layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS Grid and media queries, making the design responsive and mobile-friendly. Each course card links to a detailed course page, where users can engage with course content directly.

The course detail page contains the main interactive feature of the site — an embedded video player alongside a progress tracking system. A sample video is loaded into a standard HTML5 `<video>` element, allowing users to play, pause, and seek through the content. Below the video, there is a labeled progress bar that visually displays how much of the video has been watched. This is implemented using JavaScript by listening for time updates on the video. As the video plays, the script calculates the current percentage of time watched and updates the `<progress>` element accordingly. This simple tracking helps users see how far they’ve progressed through a course video.

Styling is handled with an external CSS file, which includes rules for layout, colors, typography, and hover effects. The header and footer remain consistent across all pages, providing a uniform structure and branding. The use of CSS Flexbox and Grid makes the layout flexible and visually organized, with clear spacing between content sections and interactive elements.

JavaScript is used sparingly and effectively. A single script file manages video progress updates on the course detail page. This makes the site fast to load and easy to maintain, while still including a useful interactive feature. There are no external libraries or frameworks used, so the entire platform runs in any modern browser with no setup beyond opening the files.

This project can be run and tested directly in Visual Studio Code using the Live Server extension. By right-clicking on any of the HTML files and selecting “Open with Live Server,” the platform can be viewed and interacted with in a browser. The layout, navigation, and progress tracking will all function without needing any backend setup.

This e-learning front end can be extended by adding features such as login pages, video libraries, certificate downloads, or saving user progress with localStorage or APIs. As it stands, the project provides a clean, functional base that demonstrates responsive layout design, simple video integration, and real-time user interaction with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.
